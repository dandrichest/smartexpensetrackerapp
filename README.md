# Overview

As a software engineer, I am dedicated to mastering modern mobile development patterns and cloud-native architectures. This project serves as a practical application of these skills, focusing on building a scalable, secure, and user-centric financial tool. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex data management and intuitive user experiences, specifically utilizing the Jetpack ecosystem and real-time cloud synchronization.

**Smart Expense Tracker** is a modern Android application designed to help users take control of their financial health. It provides a seamless interface for logging daily expenses, categorizing spending, and visualizing financial trends through interactive charts. By leveraging cloud persistence, users can ensure their data is always safe and accessible across devices.

The purpose of creating this software is to solve the common problem of "invisible spending" by providing immediate visibility into one's financial habits. It aims to empower users to make informed budgetary decisions through real-time data analysis and automated insights.
